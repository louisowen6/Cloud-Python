# Cloud-Python
When conducting a data science project, memory and time limitation often becomes a serious blocker for almost all of us who don't have *supercomputer*, at least for me. My laptop is not a *supercomputer* which has five-star specifications, and as the undergraduate student I don't have too much time to always keep put my attention to the running epochs progress in my laptop. As a data science enthusiast, I feel challenged by myself to find the solutions for this blocker. And here comes the saviour: **Google + smtplib Package!** Google offers cool technology called **Google Colaboratory**, which supports **free GPU** and is based on Google Jupyter Notebooks environment. The free GPU offered by Google Colab can help you with the memory limitation blocker. A built-in module offered by Python, **smtplib**, can help you with the time limitation blocker by sending **email notification** directly to your private mail whenever our model has been built. Now, imagine you open the email sent by python in your mobile phone and you are still far away from your laptop, with Google Colab **you can open, edit, and run your python notebook in your mobile phone!** 


## **Google Colab Setup**
1. Create new folder in your Google Drive
2. Right click on your folder, choose more, and connect more apps
3. Search *Google Colaboratory* in the search bar
4. Create new Google Colaboratory file in your folder
5. Change your runtime: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU -> Save

## Google Colab from Mobile Phone
1. Open your mobile browser (Google Chrome, Safari, etc)
2. Search *Google Colaboratory* in Google search bar
3. Make sure your gmail account is logged in
4. Open Google Colab and find your Google Colab file
5. Change your runtime: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU -> Save
